# Scientific-Calculator
Developers: Edwin Kaburu, Pierre Thomas, Stephen Ng, Scott Matsuda

# Purpose
The purpose of this application is to build a calculator system that allows the user to calculate mathematical functions and while also being able to test and improve their proficiency in arithmetic.
# Intended Audience
The intended audience for this project is directed towards young students, who are still learning basic math function and should be used in learning environment. The application will be useful for teachers, parents and others whom are interested in teaching basic arithmetic
# Project Scope
The calculator application will be on a desktop platform that will enable users to perform mathematical operations such as addition. subtraction, multiplication and division. The calculator application will contain a genuine GUI for users to perform the above process with speed and precision. This project will also contain a learning segment that will enable a user to test and improve their basic math skills. The learning segment will provide the user a choice of a variety of mathematical operations to practice on. For instance, if the user decides to practice their addition skills, the application will provide a random equation and will compare the userâ€™s input with the correct solution.
